S. E.) from London; containing 29,755 inhabitants. This place, which derives its name from the Saxon Grenawic, \"green creek\" or \"bay,\" is first noticed in the reign of Ethelred, as being for three years the station of the Danish fleet, when in 1011 those northern invaders entered this part of Kent, and, encamping on Blackheath, made predatory incursions into the surrounding parts of the country. Having devastated the city of Canterbury, and brought away Alphege, archbishop of the province, they detained him prisoner in their camp for more than seven months, and at length put him to death for refusing to exact from his diocese an exorbitant sum of money, as the price of his ransom: after his martyrdom, he was canonized; and the church of Greenwich, which had been the scene of his sufferings, was dedicated to him. The establishment of a royal residence here may be traced as far back as the reign of Edward I.; and Henry IV. dates his will, in 1408, from his manor of Greenwich, which Henry V. granted for life to Thomas Beaufort, Duke of Exeter, who died here in the year 1417. It passed afterwards to Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester, and uncle to the king; who in the year 1433 obtained a royal licence to fortify and embattle his manor-house, and to empark 200 acres of land adjoining it: he rebuilt the palace, and inclosed the park, within which he erected a tower, on the spot where the Royal Observatory now stands. On its reverting to the crown, after the death of the duke in 1447, Edward IV. expended considerable sums in enlarging and beautifying the palace, which in 1466 he granted with the manor to his queen, Elizabeth. The marriage of Richard, Duke of York, with Anne Mowbray was solemnized here with great pomp during this reign. Henry VII. resided frequently at Greenwich, where he founded a convent adjoining the palace, for a prior and twelve brethren of the order of St. Francis, which, after its dissolution in the reign of his successor, was refounded by Mary, and finally suppressed by Elizabeth in 1559. This, also, was the birthplace of Henry VIII., who was baptized in the parish church, and during whose reign it was one of the principal scenes of that splendour and festivity which distinguished his court. Here his marriages with Catherine of Arragon in 1510, and Anne of Cleves in 1540, were celebrated. The princesses Mary and Elizabeth were born here, and Edward VI. kept the festival of Christmas, 1552-3, in the palace, where he died in the month of July following. The assizes for the county were held here in the first, fourth, and fifth years of the reign of Elizabeth, and in 1577 the town sent two burgesses to parliament. Elizabeth made Greenwich her favourite summer residence. Mary, daughter of James I., was baptized here with great solemnity in 1605.\n\n=========================\nWIKIDATA CANDIDATES\n=========================\n-------------------------\n* Q179385 (Greenwich)\n-------------------------\n[Historical county] Kent\n[Description] Greenwich ( , , , or ) is an area of South East London, England, centred east-southeast of Charing Cross. It is within the Royal Borough of Greenwich, to which it lends its name. Historically it was in the county of Kent for hundreds of years, then the County of London from 1889 to 1965.  Greenwich is notable for its maritime history and for giving its name to the Greenwich Meridian (0\u00b0 longitude) and Greenwich Mean Time. The town became the site of a royal palace, the Palace of Placentia from the 15th century, and was the birthplace of many Tudors, including Henry VIII and Elizabeth I.

The origin of the name Reigate is uncertain: Camden says that, if borrowed from the ancient language, it signifies the course of the stream; while Mr. Bray and others consider it, with great probability, to be derived from the Saxon words rige or ridge, and gate; from a gate, or bar, placed across the road which runs by the high ridge of hill now called Reigate Hill. He is also inclined to think that the gate existed so early as the formation of the Saxon Stane-street; and there are many other places in the vicinity, the names of which terminate in a similar way, all apparently derived from a like circumstance. The inhabitants are recorded to have routed the Danes when they were ravaging the kingdom, on more than one occasion; and Camden has preserved a distich commemorating their courageous conduct in these engagements. The castle was taken by assault by Louis the Dauphin, in the reign of John, in revenge for the adherence of its then owner, William de Warren, to the cause of that monarch in his quarrel with the barons.

The current of the Avon, to the east of the town, is intercepted and divided into two parts by an island, from each side of which a bridge to the opposite bank of the river forms the continuation of the road to Lymington. The harbour is accessible only at high tides to vessels drawing not more than from five to six feet of water, the entrance being obstructed by a bar, or ledge of sand, extending from Henigsbury Head, on the Hampshire side (where Hengist, King of the Saxons, landed), to St. Catherine's Cliffe, in the Isle of Wight. The quay is about two miles from the mouth of the harbour. In this harbour, as in the neighbouring port of Poole, there is high water twice at every tide, a peculiarity arising from the situation of the coast with respect to the Isle of Wight, and from the projection of the point of land on which Hurst Castle is situated. The river Avon was made navigable to Salisbury in 1680, but the accumulation of sand has rendered the navigation useless.

Part of the historic county of Hampshire, Christchurch was a borough within the administrative county of Dorset from 1974 until 2019, when it became part of the new Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole unitary authority.  Founded in the seventh century at the confluence of the rivers Avon and Stour which flow into Christchurch Harbour, the town was originally named Twynham but became known as Christchurch following the construction of the priory in 1094. The town developed into an important trading port, and was fortified in the 9th century. Further defences were added in the 12th century with the construction of a castle, which was destroyed during the English Civil War by the Parliamentarian Army. During the 18th and 19th centuries smuggling flourished in Christchurch and became one of the town's most lucrative industries. The town was heavily fortified during the Second World War as a precaution against an expected invasion and in 1940 an Airspeed factory was established on the town's airfield which manufactured aircraft for the Royal Air Force.\n[Wikidata link] https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q925424\n[Wikipedia link] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christchurch%2C%20Dorset\n\n-------------------------\n* Q3334655 (Christchurch)\n-------------------------\n[Description] Christchurch is a constituency represented in the House of Commons of the UK Parliament since 1997 by Sir Christopher Chope of the Conservative Party.\n[Wikidata link] https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3334655\n[Wikipedia link] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christchurch%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29\n\n-------------------------\n* Q27080400 (Christ Church)\n-------------------------\n[Historical county] Middlesex\n[Description] {'City of Westminster, Greater London, W1J'}\n[Wikidata link] https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q27080400\n\n-------------------------\n* Q16258224 (Christ Church, Ottershaw)\n-------------------------\n[Historical county] Surrey\n[Description] Christ Church, Ottershaw is a Church of England church on Guildford Road in the village of Ottershaw in the Runnymede district of Surrey, England, about 20 miles south-west of London.

During the heptarchy, it appears to have been patronised by the kings of Mercia, of whom Peada, son-in-law of Osweo, King of Northumbria, having been converted by the preaching of Cedd, a hermit who had a cell near the site of St. Chad's church, is said to have erected the first Christian church here in honour of that recluse, who had been assiduous in his efforts to convert the Mercians to Christianity, and afterwards became their bishop. In the reign of Offa, this see not only obtained the precedence of all the Mercian bishoprics, but through the interest of Offa with Pope Adrian, was made the arcbiepiscopal see, and invested with the greater part of the jurisdiction of Canterbury. Eadwulph was appointed archbishop of Lichfield in 789, and had for his suffragans the Bishops of Worcester, Hereford, Leicester, Sidnacester, Elmham, and Dunwich; but in 803, Leo succeeding to the pontificate, restored the primacy to Canterbury, and Eadulph, stripped of his supremacy, died in 812.\n\n=========================\nWIKIDATA CANDIDATES\n=========================\n-------------------------\n* Q26487618 (Lichfield)\n-------------------------\n[Historical county] Sussex\n[Description] {'Little Horsted, Wealden, East Sussex, TN22'}\n[Wikidata link] https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q26487618\n\n-------------------------\n* Q28599740 (Lichfield)\n-------------------------\n[Description] {'civil parish in Lichfield District, Staffordshire, England'}\n[Wikidata link] https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q28599740\n\n-------------------------\n* Q1080391 (Lichfield)\n-------------------------\n[Description] Lichfield is a constituency in Staffordshire represented in the House of Commons of the UK Parliament since its 1997 recreation by Michael Fabricant, a Conservative.\n[Wikidata link] https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1080391\n[Wikipedia link] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lichfield%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29\n\n-------------------------\n* Q1823259 (Lichfield)\n-------------------------\n[Description] Lichfield () is a local government district in Staffordshire, England.

This place is unquestionably of great antiquity, but whether it owes its foundation to the Romans or to the Saxons is a matter involved in great doubt. Its name rather tends to strengthen the supposition that its origin is to be attributed to the latter people, the term Reading being most probably derived from the Saxon words Rhea, \"a river\" or \"an overflowing,\" and Ing, \"a meadow.\" It is noticed in 871, by Asser, the biographer of Alfred, as a fortified town which was seized by the Danes, and to which, after their defeat at Englefield by Earl Ethelwolf, they retired and were pursued by that Saxon nobleman, who was killed in attempting to take the town. During the reign of Alfred, and occasionally in the time of his successors, the Danes appear to have again held possession of the place; and on the invasion of Sweyn, King of Denmark, to avenge the massacre of his countrymen in the reign of Ethelred, it was burnt to the ground in 1006, together with the nunnery founded here by Elfrida in expiation of the murder of her step-son, Edward the Martyr.

Situated in the Thames Valley at the confluence of the rivers Thames and Kennet, it is on the Great Western Main Line railway and the M4 motorway. Reading is east of Bristol, south of Oxford, west of London, north of Basingstoke, south-west of Maidenhead and east of Newbury.  The first evidence for Reading as a town dates from the 8th century. It was an important trading and ecclesiastical centre in the medieval period, as the site of Reading Abbey, one of the largest and richest monasteries of medieval England with strong royal connections, of which the 12th-century abbey gateway and significant ancient ruins remain. By 1525, Reading was the largest town in Berkshire, and tax returns show that Reading was the 10th largest town in England when measured by taxable wealth. The medieval town was seriously affected by the English Civil War, with a major siege and loss of trade, and played a pivotal role in the Revolution of 1688, with that revolution's only significant military action fought on the streets of the town. The 18th century saw the beginning of a major iron works in the town and the growth of the brewing trade for which Reading was to become famous. The 19th century saw the coming of the Great Western Railway and the development of the town's brewing, baking and seed growing businesses. During that period, the town grew rapidly as a manufacturing centre.\n[Wikidata link] https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q161491\n[Wikipedia link] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reading%2C%20Berkshire\n\n-------------------------\n* Q21496716 (Reading)\n-------------------------\n[Description] {'district in Berkshire, England'}\n[Wikidata link] https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q21496716\n=========================\n": "", "=========================\nBHO ENTRY [ID 2735]: Burstall (St. Mary)\n=========================\nBURSTALL (St. Mary), a parish, in the incorporation and hundred of Samford, E. division of Suffolk, 4\u00bd miles (W.) from Ipswich; containing 223 inhabitants.

Bypassed by the A15, it is connected to Lincoln and Peterborough, as well as Newark and King's Lynn (via the A17). At the 2011 Census, Quarrington and Mareham ward, which incorporates most of the settlement, had an estimated population of 7,046.  Quarrington was a rural community during the early and middle Anglo-Saxon period while mills along the River Slea in the Middle Ages gave the village its likely alternative name of Millthorpe. The Bishop of Lincoln and Ramsey Abbey held manors in Quarrington after the Norman Conquest, but the Carre family of Sleaford were the principal land-owners between 1559 and 1683, when its estate passed by marriage to the Marquesses of Bristol. Although the growth of Victorian Sleaford saw the town encroach into the parish's boundaries, the old village remained a small cluster of farm buildings and cottages for much of its history. The sale of most of the surrounding farmland by successive Marquesses of Bristol in the late 20th century led to the rapid development of residential estates on Quarrington Hill and in New Quarrington which have engulfed the original settlement.

The historic village of Fairfield was centred around a village green (known as 'the Green').  The name Fairfield derives from the Germanic \"faeger feld\" meaning 'fair open land', because of its good volcanic soil for pasture. Cistercian monks and Benedictine nuns founded monastic granges at Fairfield in the early 1200s AD (Nunsfield Farm still exists). In the 13th century Fairfield (being north of the River Wye) was within the Royal Forest of Peak, a hunting ground for the king. Fairfield was a chapelry in the parish of Hope (whereas Buxton was in the Bakewell parish). Fairfield and Buxton shared a medieval corn mill on the Wye in Mill Dale, where Ashwood Park is now. Fairfield became a town in its own right, complete with town council. The township covered the land north of the River Wye, including The Park and Devonshire Park, until 1859 when a boundary change moved them into Buxton town. Fairfield remained an urban sanitary district until 1894 and in 1917 it became part of Buxton Urban District Council. In 1811, 1821 and 1831, the chapelry of Fairfield returned a population of 482 inhabitants in the national censuses.The first chapel was built in Fairfield between 1240 and 1255. Fairfield Church was built in c.1595 and was demolished in 1838 to be replaced by the present St. Peter's (Church of England). Lying just north of the 'Green', the church was built in 1839, designed by William Swan, the village schoolmaster. St Peter's is a Grade II listed building. John Wesley visited Fairfleld in September 1784. Fairfield Wesleyan chapel on Waterswallows Road was built in 1868, replacing the first Methodist chapel which was erected in 1844. After 1887 it was used as the Fairfield Local Board Town Hall.\n[Wikidata link] https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q15217217\n[Wikipedia link] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairfield%2C%20Derbyshire\n\n-------------------------\n* Q26291830 (Fairfield)\n-------------------------\n[Historical county] Cumberland\n[Description] {'Burgh By Sands, Carlisle, Cumbria, CA5'}\n[Wikidata link] https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q26291830\n\n-------------------------\n* Q26403605 (Fairfield)\n-------------------------\n[Historical county] Berkshire\n[Description] {'Sunninghill and Ascot, Windsor and Maidenhead, Berkshire, SL5'}\n[Wikidata link] https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q26403605\n\n-------------------------\n* Q26567260 (Fairfield)\n-------------------------\n[Historical county] Surrey\n[Description] {'Chiddingfold, Waverley, Surrey, GU8'}\n[Wikidata link] https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q26567260\n\n-------------------------\n* Q26443998 (Fairfield)\n-------------------------\n[Historical county] Yorkshire\n[Description] {'Exelby, Leeming and Newton, Hambleton, North Yorkshire, DL8'}\n[Wikidata link] https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q26443998\n\n-------------------------\n* Q5430214 (Fairfield, Liverpool)\n-------------------------\n[Historical county] Lancashire\n[Description] Fairfield is an area of Liverpool, in Merseyside, England, encompassing streets between Tuebrook and Kensington and stretching to Old Swan.

The chancel screen and other furnishings were provided by Temple Moore in 1898-99 and rood beam figures by Lang of Oberammergau. The church's very unusual heating system was based on the Roman Hypocaust. Warm air came through underfloor ducts from a coke-fired stove beneath the church. Originally the fuel for the stove was carried through a 25-foot brick-lined tunnel on a miniature railway which is still in existence but rarely used.

The village saw rapid growth during the 20th century as a result of the construction of Smiths Aerospace factory near the village after the Second World War. Currently, population and residential growth is a contentious subject due to the vast expansion of the housing estates without increased amenities. At the moment, a bid for 500 more houses has been refused but is currently under appeal.\n[Wikidata link] https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4917406\n[Wikipedia link] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishop%27s%20Cleeve\n=========================\n": "", "=========================\nBHO ENTRY [ID 3236]: Chapel-En-Le-Frith (St. Thomas \u00e0 Becket)\n=========================\nCHAPEL-EN-LE-FRITH (St. Thomas \u00e0 Becket), a market-town and parish, and the head of a union, in the hundred of High Peak, N. division of the county of Derby, 41 miles (N.

A small subscription library was established a few years since. The principal branch of manufacture is that of cotton, in which more than 300 people are employed: about 100 persons are engaged in the manufacture of paper, chiefly for the London newspapers; and there are a rope-walk and an iron-forge near the town; also several coal-mines in the parish. The Peak Forest canal passes three miles to the north-west, and, by means of a railway, communicates with the Peak Forest limeworks, about three miles to the east of the town: there is a reservoir in the parish that occasionally supplies the canal with water. The market, which is on Thursday, has greatly declined: the fairs, most of which also are insignificant, are on the Thursday before February 13th, on March 24th and 29th, the Thursday before Easter, April 30th, Holy-Thursday, and the third Thursday after, for cattle; July 7th, for wool; the Thursday preceding August 24th, for sheep and cheese; and the Thursday after September 29th, and the Thursday before November 11th, for cattle.

The town is situated on an eminence rising gradually from the western bank of the river Rea, over which is a neat stone bridge, and consists principally of one long street, containing many good houses, and the mutilated remains of an old cross; the inhabitants are plentifully supplied with excellent water from a spring that has its source in the Brown Clee hills, and falls into a spacious basin in the lower part of the town. From its retired situation, in a district almost inaccessible in consequence of the badness of the roads, the trade is rapidly declining; formerly there were some important iron-works, but there are now only two forges. A few of the inhabitants are employed in the manufacture of paper, for which there are two mills. On the Clee hills, about three miles west of the town, are large collieries, producing excellent coal; and on the higher part of them is a remarkably fine, though not extensive, vein of cannel coal, of which many beautiful specimens have been worked into snuff-boxes and ornaments of various kinds, Common stone is also quarried. The market, granted to Sir Francis Lacon in 1614, is held on Wednesday; the fairs are on April 21st, Trinity-Monday, and October 27th. The powers of the county-debt court of Cleobury, established in 1847, extend over the registration-district of Cleobury.\n\n=========================\nWIKIDATA CANDIDATES\n=========================\n-------------------------\n* Q2575384 (Cleobury Mortimer)\n-------------------------\n[Historical county] Shropshire\n[Description] Cleobury Mortimer (, ) is a small market town and civil parish in southeastern Shropshire, England, which had a population of 3,036 at the 2011 census.

In the Saxon Chronicle this place is called Swanawic; Asser Menevensis styles it Swanavine and Gnavewic, and in Domesday book it is written Swanwic and Sonwic. The earliest and principal historical circumstance on record connected with it is the destruction by a violent storm, in 877, of a Danish fleet of 120 sail, on Peveril Point, at the south-eastern entrance of the bay on which the town stands, when advancing to the relief of the Danish troops in the city of Exeter. A similar disaster is said to have befallen another of their fleets, after its defeat by Alfred, in the same place and year. The town consists principally of a street about a mile long, containing many neat houses built and roofed with stone; and the bay having of late years become a place of resort for bathing, some new houses have been erected, among which are a library containing more than 2000 volumes, and the Royal Victoria hotel, a spacious building sheltered in its different aspects from all winds, and containing hot and cold sea-water baths. The bay, though not large, is beautiful, and affords security for vessels of 300 tons' burthen, which can ride here steadily except when the wind blows from the east; the sands afford pleasant walks and drives. Considerable improvements have taken place in the neighbourhood; and the mildness and salubrity of the air, possessing all the advantages of a southern climate, render the town peculiarly desirable as a winter residence. The manufacture of straw-plat and shirt-buttons employs most of the young females, and the chief occupation of the men is in working the numerous quarries in the southern part of the parish, which produce great quantities of excellent freestone called Purbeck stone. The quarry-men are governed by local laws or regulations, by which none but their sons, who must serve an apprenticeship of seven years, are allowed to work.

According to the well-known legendary story, Llewelyn, on his return from the chase, perceiving the mouth of the dog stained with blood, hastened to the nursery, and finding the cradle overturned, and the floor streaming with blood, rashly concluded that his son had been killed by the hound, and instantly drew his sword and stabbed the faithful animal. But on removing the cradle, he found his child unhurt, and sleeping quietly by the side of the wolf, which the watchful Gelert had killed. Stung with remorse, Llewelyn erected a tomb over the dog's grave, not far from which the conventual church was afterwards built; and from this circumstance the place obtained the appellation of Bedd-Gelert, or \"the Grave of Gelert.\" But Mr. Rowlands has traced the existence of this monastic establishment to a period long anterior to the above, even prior to the reign of Owain Gwynedd, from whom it received an endowment of lands, &c., which was augmented by Llewelyn.\n\n=========================\nWIKIDATA CANDIDATES\n=========================\n-------------------------\n* Q4860547 (Bargate)\n-------------------------\n[Historical county] Hampshire\n[Description] The Bargate is a Grade I listed medieval gatehouse in the city centre of Southampton, England.

They occupy the whole centre of County Wicklow and stretch outside its borders into the counties of Dublin, Wexford and Carlow. Where the mountains extend into County Dublin, they are known locally as the Dublin Mountains (\"Sl\u00e9ibhte Bhaile \u00c1tha Cliath\"). The highest peak is Lugnaquilla at .  The mountains are primarily composed of granite surrounded by an envelope of mica-schist and much older rocks such as quartzite. They were pushed up during the Caledonian orogeny at the start of the Devonian period and form part of the Leinster Chain, the largest continuous area of granite in Ireland and Britain. The mountains owe much of their present topography to the effects of the last ice age, which deepened the valleys and created corrie and ribbon lakes. Copper and lead have been the main metals mined in the mountains and a brief gold rush occurred in the 18th century.\n[Wikidata link] https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q945002\n[Wikipedia link] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicklow%20Mountains\n=========================\n": "", "=========================\nBHO ENTRY [ID 5706]: Fenrother\n=========================\nFENROTHER, a township, in the parochial chapelry of Hebburn, union of Morpeth, W. division of Morpeth ward, N. division of Northumberland, 4 miles (N.

The village of Cynwyd, on the road from Corwen to Bala and Dinas-Mowddwy, is situated 2 miles (S. W.) from Corwen. It is noted as the place where a court for the thirteen baronies contained within the comot of Edeyrnion was anciently held, chiefly for the purpose of settling the boundaries of the lords' claims upon the wastes and commons, and for taking cognizance of encroachments; but a disagreement arising among the lords, the records were destroyed, and the court has since been discontinued. The river Trustion runs through this village, about half a mile above which it pours its waters over a precipitous ledge of rocks, upwards of sixty feet high, and forms a pleasing cascade. The first fall rushes through a narrow chasm, about forty feet in perpendicular height, and is received into a basin, measuring at least ten feet in diameter, whence it pursues its course for several yards along a rocky ridge, and then rolls over, in three falls of about twenty feet, into a natural reservoir more capacious than the former. Within a short distance of this, after passing through the dingle and the village, it empties itself into the Dee. There are two flannel manufactories and a corn-mill upon the stream; the cornmill is situated near the bottom of the waterfall, and contributes materially to the picturesque character of the scenery, which, from the rocky declivities being in many places well clothed with wood, is pleasing and attractive. Fairs are held on August 6th and October 21st. A school-room was built at Cynwyd by subscription, in consequence of a bequest of \u00a3200 by Hugh Roberts, in 1807, the produce to be applied to the instruction of children. There are places of worship for Baptists, Calvinistic Methodists, and Independents, with a Sunday school held in each of them. Morris Edwards, in 1822, bequeathed \u00a3100 for the benefit of the poor of the division, the interest of which is regularly distributed among them at Christmas. Near T\u0177'n-y-Wern is a remarkably fine oak, about ninety feet high, the trunk of which, at the distance of seven feet from the ground, measures twenty feet in girth, and one of its branches thirteen: there is also in the vicinity a very large elm-tree, eleven feet in circumference.\n\n=========================\nWIKIDATA CANDIDATES\n=========================\n-------------------------\n* Q5197219 (Cwmavon)\n-------------------------\n[Historical county] Glamorgan\n[Description] Cwmafan (; ), sometimes known as Cwmavon in English, is a large village and community in the Afan valley in Wales, lying within Neath Port Talbot County Borough.

In many ways it is a suburb of the nearby town of Port Talbot which is less than to the south. The literal translation of \"Cwmafan\" from Welsh to English is complex, Cwm means valley with Afan as the name of the river flowing through, hence the village residing within the Afan Valley. It could be a version of Afon which means river, so literally the \"River Valley\", this is common in Wales and the UK with many rivers being called Afon or Avon.

The parish comprises an area of 23,294 acres, of which 11,500 are, or until very lately were, all common or waste. It is intersected by the river Moch, in English signifying \"rapid,\" which here separates the counties of Denbigh and Montgomery, and which, at the distance of four miles from the village, forms the much-admired waterfall called Pistyll Rhaiadr, rendering the place, especially during the summer months, the resort of numerous visitors on their route through this part of North Wales. The total perpendicular height of the waterfall is 240 feet; but the immediate vicinity of it is so crowded and overshadowed with the growth of recent plantations of firs and other evergreens, as to diminish the effect of this otherwise strikingly grand scene. The river, flowing along a narrow valley which terminates in a precipitous and bold declivity of the Berwyn mountains, after gliding over a shelving rocky projection for a short distance, precipitates itself with great impetuosity down a perpendicular descent of more than 150 feet (part of the 240), and, being interrupted by a projecting mass of rock, through which it has worn a channel, forms a second descent beneath a lofty arch to the base of the mountain. The road leading from the village to Pistyll Rhaiadr has been greatly improved. From the cataract the river pursues its course through the village into the Tanat, a larger stream, descending from the hills above Pennant, and flowing along an extensive valley commencing at Llangynog, and continued through the parish to Pen-y-Bont, below Llangedwin. In this parish the Tanat is also joined by another tributary, called the Twrch. The Vale of Tanat, along which is an excellent turnpike-road from Oswestry and Shrewsbury, through Llangynog, to Bala, is remarkable for the fertility of its soil, and the beauty and variety of its scenery, and is much admired by tourists, as affording a succession of interesting features. The lands bordering upon the Tanat are subject to inundation, but the rest of the parish, which has every where an uneven surface, is chiefly elevated: the soil is various, but for the most part gravelly. The manufacture of woollen cloth is carried on to a small extent, and several of the inhabitants are employed in making shoes. A small market is held under a building called \"the townhall;\" and fairs take place annually on the first Friday in March, on May 5th, July 24th, September 28th, and November 8th.\n\n=========================\nWIKIDATA CANDIDATES\n=========================\n-------------------------\n* Q17529296 (Lanherne Carmelite Convent)\n-------------------------\n[Historical county] Cornwall\n[Description] {'Grade I listed building in Cornwall, United Kingdom'}\n[Wikidata link] https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q17529296\n=========================\n": "", "=========================\nBHO ENTRY [ID 17079]: 1565\u201366\n=========================\nAfter Tomworth's futile mission in August to prevent what had already taken place, and solder quarrels, Mary took the field against Chatelherault, Murray, and other opponents of the marriage; and by 8th September they were driven to Dumfries,40 whence, after vain efforts to get assistance from Elizabeth, who replied evasively on 1st October,41 they fled across the Border to Newcastle.

That the insufferable presumption of Darnley, chafing at being a king only in name, moved him to gain the crown matrimonial despite Mary's refusal to give it; besides which he had conceived violent suspicion of her secretary, though a prime agent in forwarding his marriage, as guilty of his dishonour; and, lastly, the desire of the Protestant party to have their banished leaders home made them ready to join in his design.48\n\n=========================\nWIKIDATA CANDIDATES\n=========================\n-------------------------\n* Q26418674 (61-64)\n-------------------------\n[Historical county] Buckinghamshire\n[Description] {'Hambleden, Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, RG9'}\n[Wikidata link] https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q26418674\n=========================\n": "", "=========================\nBHO ENTRY [ID 18135]: Llysin\n=========================\nLLYSIN, a hamlet, in the parish of Carno, union of Newtown and Llanidloes, Lower division of the hundred of Llanidloes, county of Montgomery, North Wales, 10 miles (N.

Originally built from wood by the Hilton (later Hylton) family shortly after the Norman Conquest in 1066, it was later rebuilt in stone in the late 14th to early 15th century. The castle underwent major changes to its interior and exterior in the 18th century and it remained the principal seat of the Hylton family until the death of the last Baron in 1746. It was then Gothicised but neglected until 1812, when it was revitalised by a new owner. Standing empty again until the 1840s, it was briefly used as a school until it was purchased again in 1862.

This place, which derives the adjunct to its name from its situation on the moors, was of little importance prior to 1337, when the emigrant Flemings, who fixed their residence here, introduced the manufacture of woollen-cloth, and laid the foundation of its future increase as a manufacturing town. After the revocation of the edict of Nantz, also, many of the French refugees, attracted by the means of employment which its trade at that time afforded, took up their abode in the town. At the commencement of the civil war in the reign of Charles I., the inhabitants espoused the cause of the parliament, by whom the town was garrisoned, and in whose possession it remained till 1644, when Prince Rupert, advancing with 10,000 men to the relief of Lathom House, which was besieged by a body of 2000 parliamentary troops, compelled them to raise the siege and retire into this town. Being joined by the Earl of Derby from the Isle of Man, the prince assembled his forces on the moor to the south-west of the town, and there held a council of war, at which it was resolved to carry the place by storm. Pursuant to this, an assault was made with great spirit and bravery, which, however was met by equal intrepidity from the garrison, now consisting of 3000 men; and the assailants, after performing numerous acts of valour, were compelled to retreat, with the loss of 200 of their force. A second council of war was then convened, and a second attack determined upon, which, at his earnest request, was entrusted to the Earl of Derby: this loyal nobleman, placing himself at the head of a gallant band of only 200 Lancashire men, principally his own tenantry and their sons, led on the van, by marching directly to the walls, where the conflict was for some time carried on with desperate valour on both sides; but the earl, bearing down all opposition, entered the town, and put the whole garrison into the utmost consternation. The royalists pursued the enemy in every direction, killing all whom they encountered; and at last plundered the town, which remained for some time in their possession, but was ultimately given up to the parliament. After the disastrous battle of Worcester, the gallant earl, who had come from the Isle of Man to the assistance of Charles II., being taken prisoner, was condemned by a military tribunal at Chester, and sent under an escort to this place, where he was beheaded.\n\n=========================\nWIKIDATA CANDIDATES\n=========================\n-------------------------\n* Q3003116 (Boltongate)\n-------------------------\n[Historical county] Cumberland\n[Description] Boltongate is a village in Cumbria, England.

It survived until 1974 when it was rejoined with East Suffolk. Its county town was Bury St Edmunds.  Before the introduction of county councils, Suffolk had been divided into eastern and western divisions, each with their own quarter sessions. The western division corresponded to the Liberty of Saint Edmund. This area had been established by Edward the Confessor in 1044 and was a separate jurisdiction under the control of the abbot of Bury St Edmunds Abbey until the dissolution of the monasteries.\n[Wikidata link] https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q371272\n[Wikipedia link] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West%20Suffolk%20%28county%29\n\n-------------------------\n* Q874416 (West Suffolk)\n-------------------------\n[Description] West Suffolk is a constituency represented in the House of Commons of the UK Parliament since 2010 by Matt Hancock, a Conservative.

S. E.) from Haslingden; containing, with the hamlets of Deadwin-Clough, Tunstead, and Wolfenden, and part of the consolidated chapelry of Bacup, 11,668 inhabitants. The name of Rossendale is probably formed from the British word Rhos, expressive of the dusky colour of the heath grass. In the 4th of Edward II. the Forest or Chase was divided into eleven vaccaries, or cow-pastures, of which the herbage was valued at 10s. for each: in the reign of Henry VII. the number of vaccaries, or booths, had increased to nineteen, of which the herbage was estimated at advanced rents, varying from 13s. to \u00a313. Like the vaccaries of Pendle, these booths were the foundations of townships; the township of \"Dedquene-Cloghe,\" now Deadwin-Clough, contains the village of Newchurch. The length of the chapelry is five miles, and its breadth three; it comprises 5726 acres, and consists of three valleys, with their corresponding elevations. Although the hills are high, and naturally sterile, modern improvements, cherished by manufacturing prosperity, have carried cultivation to their summits; the arable land is about a fifth of the whole. The chapelry is watered on the south by the Irwell, which, rising at the foot of Dirplay Hill, in Cliviger, descends to Bacup by Broadclough, and passing Wolfenden runs by Tottington to Bury. At the head of Wolfenden rises Whitewell brook, which empties itself into the Irwell below the village of Newchurch. Coal-mines, and quarries of freestone, slate, &c., abound in the chapelry; and cotton and woollen goods are manufactured to a considerable extent, in their various branches. A fair for cattle is held on April 29th, and one for clothing and pedlery on the first Monday after the 24th of June. The living is a perpetual curacy; net income, \u00a3231; patron, the Vicar of Whalley. The chapel was originally built in 1512, and was the first place of worship erected in Rossendale Forest; in 1825 it was rebuilt, partly at the cost of the parishioners and partly by a government grant. It is in the pointed style of architecture, with lancet windows, and a handsome tower; the interior, which is light and substantial, consists of a nave, aisles, and choir. There are churches at Lumb and Tunstead; and the Wesleyans, Baptists, Unitarians, and other dissenters, have places of worship. A free grammar school was founded in 1701 by John Kershaw, who endowed it with lands situated in Heald, in Bacup; and there are large national schools.\n\n=========================\nWIKIDATA CANDIDATES\n=========================\n-------------------------\n* Q77781350 (17 Newmill Road, Struthers)\n-------------------------\n[Historical county] Ayrshire\n[Description] {'architectural structure in East Ayrshire, Scotland, UK'}\n[Wikidata link] https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q77781350\n=========================\n": "", "=========================\nBHO ENTRY [ID 4559]: Dean-Bottom\n=========================\nDEAN-BOTTOM, a hamlet, in the parish of Horton-Kirby, union of Dartford, hundred of Axton, Dartford, and Wilmington, lathe of Sutton-at-Hone, W. division of Kent; with 63 inhabitants.\n\n=========================\nWIKIDATA CANDIDATES\n=========================\n-------------------------\n* Q1229166 (Dunster)\n-------------------------\n[Historical county] Somerset\n[Description] Dunster is a village, civil parish and former manor within the English county of Somerset, today just within the north-eastern boundary of the Exmoor National Park.

Iron Age hillforts testify to occupation of the area for thousands of years. The village grew up around Dunster Castle which was built on the Tor by the Norman warrior William I de Moyon (d. post 1090) shortly after the Norman Conquest of 1066. The Castle is mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086. From that time it was the \"caput\" of the Feudal barony of Dunster. The Castle was remodelled on several occasions by the Luttrell family who were lords of the manor from the 14th to 20th centuries. The benedictine Dunster Priory was established in about 1100.

As the town of Bournemouth expanded, Littledown remained as a farming community with areas of open fields on the town's northern edge, with the Cooper-Dean family residing in Littledown House. Eventually however the only Cooper-Dean descendants were two spinster sisters who sold Littledown House, with the surrounding farmland, to Bournemouth Council in the early 1980s. After public discussion on what the Council would do with the area, eventually much of the land was sold off for housing, although a large section was set by for a park and a sports centre.  Most of the built environment that now makes up Littledown was subsequently developed in the 1980s. Notable buildings include the Chaseside Campus of JPMorgan, the Royal Bournemouth Hospital, Bournemouth County Court and the Littledown Leisure Centre.

This parish derives its name from the situation of its church, at the head of a beautiful lake called Mwyngil. It extends eight miles in length and four in breadth, and includes a large portion of the lofty mountain Cader Idris. The area is about thirty-six thousand acres, of which only about six thousand are under cultivation, the remainder consisting chiefly of barren rugged hills, merely affording pasturage to sheep and goats. In the lower grounds the soil, though shallow, is enriched by several small rivers, which descend from the hills in various parts. The scenery is strikingly romantic, and derives much beauty from two lakes within the limits of the parish; one, called Ll&ygrave;n Cae, at the foot of Cader Idris, about a quarter of a mile long and nearly of equal breadth; and the other, called Mwyngil, which is the principal, more than a mile in length, and something less than half a mile broad. The latter abounds with excellent trout and eels: the vale in which it is situated is so contracted as to leave, for a considerable part of its length, only a very narrow road on each side of the water, and the clear surface of the lake reflects the precipitous acclivities on each side. Towards the extremity of the vale, the lake contracts gradually into the form of a river, rushing with rapidity through a stone arch into a very narrow pass, having on one side the church, and on the other the small cluster of houses which form the village, embosomed in trees, and assuming a romantically beautiful appearance. At the distance of a mile or two beyond the church, the hills almost meet, and present a sterile and rugged aspect; they are broken into numberless crags, of which some are vertical and sharply pointed, but the greater number project horizontally, and impend with threatening gloom over the vale beneath. One of these precipices, from its resemblance in form to a harp, has been called Pen-y-Delyn; and another, from a tradition that it was formerly the practice to throw thieves from its summit, has been denominated Llamy-Lladron, or \"the thieves' leap.\" There were formerly some ancient seats in the parish, the principal of which were Aberlleveni and Maes-y-Pandy; but they have been abandoned by their proprietors, and are now occupied by tenants.

In 1158 it was besieged and taken by Roger, Earl of Clare, but in 1189 was retaken by Maelgwyn ab Rh\u0177s, who in 1194 gave it to Anarawd, his brother, as a ransom for the liberation of his two brothers Hywel and Madoc, whom that chieftain had made prisoners. It did not remain long in the possession of Anarawd, for Maelgwyn again retook it in 1198, and kept it till the year 1207, when, despairing of being able to defend the fortress against Llewelyn ab Iorwerth, Prince of North Wales, from whom he expected a hostile attack, he razed it to the ground. From that time it does not appear that it was ever rebuilt.\n\n=========================\nWIKIDATA CANDIDATES\n=========================\n-------------------------\n* Q55029412 (St Therese's Church)\n-------------------------\n[Historical county] County Sligo\n[Description] {'church in Ballintogher, County Sligo, Ireland'}\n[Wikidata link] https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q55029412\n=========================\n": "", "=========================\nBHO ENTRY [ID 8029]: Hurdcott\n=========================\nHURDCOTT, a hamlet, in the parish of Baverstock, union of Wilton, hundred of Cawden and Cadworth, Hindon and S. divisions of the county of Wilts; containing 58 inhabitants.\n\n=========================\nWIKIDATA CANDIDATES\n=========================\n-------------------------\n* Q26587369 (Hurdcott House)\n-------------------------\n[Historical county] Wiltshire\n[Description] Hurdcott House is a country house in Barford St Martin, Wiltshire, England, roughly west of Salisbury.

The village is pleasantly situated on the river Sochan: the parish, which is entirely agricultural, contains about 3000 acres of land, the whole of it inclosed. The living is a perpetual curacy, endowed with a rent-charge of \u00a312 private benefaction, with \u00a3600 royal bounty, and \u00a31000 parliamentary grant; net income, \u00a3107; patron and impropriator, C. G. Wynne, Esq., whose tithes have been commuted for a rent-charge of \u00a3181. 10. 6. The church is a small edifice in good repair, and is appropriately fitted up for the accommodation of the parishioners. There are places of worship for Calvinistic Methodists, Independents, and Wesleyans, with a Sunday school held in each of them. In 1784, Robert Evans bequeathed \u00a380 for teaching a Welsh school for this parish and those of Aberdaron, Llanvaelrh\u0177s, and Rhiw, which being subsequently augmented by subscriptions in each parish, a small house, premises, and above six acres of land, were purchased in the parish of Llaniestyn, now yielding about \u00a39 per annum. Of this rent, half is now given to a schoolmaster at Aberdaron, for instructing children of that parish and Llanvaelrh\u0177s, and half to a schoolmaster at Br&ygrave;ncroes, for this parish and Rhiw; the former plan of holding a school in each of the four parishes for a year, in rotation, having been discontinued. The master here also receives \u00a33. 13. 6. per annum, being half the rent of a tenement and fourteen acres of land devised by Griffith Hughes, in 1818, for purposes of education in the parishes of Br&ygrave;ncroes and Llangwnadl. In consideration of these two payments, he teaches all the poor children of Br&ygrave;ncroes and Rhiw who apply for admission, his only other advantages being a house and garden, and about \u00a32 a year arising from a quarterage of 2s. paid by a few of the scholars. One or two small bequests are appropriated to the relief of the poor; and the rent of a piece of land, amounting to 15s. a year, is applied to the repairs of the church. An ancient chapel, called T\u0177-Vair, or \"St. Mary's Chapel,\" formerly stood near the church; in the vicinity of which, also, are Fynnon-Vair, \"St. Mary's Well,\" and Cae-Vair, \"St. Mary's Field.\" A kist-vaen, or stone coffin, in which was an urn containing burnt bones and ashes, was discovered some years since, on the grounds of T\u0177-Mawr, in the parish; and near a house called Monacht\u0177 was formerly a cromlech.\n\n=========================\nWIKIDATA CANDIDATES\n=========================\n-------------------------\n* Q28152644 (Our Lady Star of the Sea Church)\n-------------------------\n[Historical county] County Clare\n[Description] {'church in Quilty, Ireland'}\n[Wikidata link] https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q28152644\n=========================\n": "", "=========================\nBHO ENTRY [ID 3564]: Church\n=========================\nCHURCH, a tything, in the parish of Downton, union of Alderbury, hundred of Downton, Salisbury and Amesbury, and S. divisions of Wilts; containing 319 inhabitants.\n\n=========================\nWIKIDATA CANDIDATES\n==================================================\n": "", "=========================\nBHO ENTRY [ID 17107]: CORRECTIONS AND ADDITIONS.\n=========================\nPage 125, vol. i.\u2014Brecknockshire.

W. by W.) from London; containing, with the hamlet of Wilstone, and the ehapelry of Long Marston, 4260 inhabitants, of whom 2772 are in the town. This place is of remote antiquity. The opinion that it is of Roman origin receives confirmation from the fact that the lkeneld-way from Dorchester to Colchester passed in its vicinity; and at the time of the division of the county by Alfred, it was considered of sufficient importance to give name to the hundred in which it was situated, being then called Treung. Antiquaries have attributed the derivation of its name to the form of the town, which they suppose to have been originally triangular. It consists principally of two streets, the larger crossed at the top by the other, and both containing good houses, generally of modern style. Contiguous to it is the elegant mansion of Tring Park (built by Charles II., for his favourite mistress, Eleanor Gwynn, and since modernised), with the hills rising in the back-ground, clothed with fine beech-trees. The general appearance of the town is exceedingly neat, the atmosphere salubrious, and the inhabitants are amply supplied with water.\n\n=========================\nWIKIDATA CANDIDATES\n==================================================\n": "", "=========================\nBHO ENTRY [ID 17085]: MARGINAL REFERENCES.\n=========================\nRefer to . .
